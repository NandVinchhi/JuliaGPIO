## Overview
Via this tutorial, we shall be going over the entire process of installation and use of the Julia Programming language on a Raspberry Pi. We will be using the [PiGPIO.jl](https://github.com/JuliaBerry/PiGPIO.jl) library for controlling GPIO elements (namely LEDs). 

## What you'll need
You will require a Raspberry Pi (I am using a Raspberry Pi 3 model B+), along with the standard peripherals(keyboard, mouse, display, power supply), 1 breadboard, 2 resistors, 2 LEDs and jumper wires. I am assuming that you have the Raspbian OS set up and running on the Raspberry Pi. If not, take a look at [this tutorial.](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up)
